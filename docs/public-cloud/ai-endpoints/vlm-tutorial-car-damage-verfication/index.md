# VLM Tutorial - Car Damage Verification

Build an interactive AI-powered car verification system using OVHcloud Vision Language Models.

## What You'll Build

An interactive car verification challenge that:
- Collects user claims about their vehicle (make, model, color, damage)
- Analyzes uploaded photos using Vision Language Models
- Cross-references visual evidence with textual claims
- Provides detailed verification reports with confidence levels
- Demonstrates multi-modal AI capabilities

## Learning Path

1. [**Setup Guide**](setup-guide.md) - Complete step-by-step tutorial
2. **Download Scripts** - [All Python files](/ovhcloud-workbooks/public-cloud/ai-endpoints/vlm-tutorial-car-damage-verfication/scripts/)

## Demo Overview

The **Car Verification Challenge** is an interactive fact-checking experiment where users:

1. **Make claims** about their car (manufacturer, model, color, damage)
2. **Upload photos** of the actual vehicle (minimum 3 photos)
3. **Get AI analysis** that verifies if the photos match their claims
4. **Receive a verdict** - truth or deception detected!

## Key Features

- **Multi-modal AI** - Combines text and image analysis
- **Interactive interface** - User-friendly Chainlit web application
- **Real-time verification** - Live AI-powered fact-checking
- **Educational demonstrations** - Learn about AI vision capabilities
- **Practical applications** - Insurance, automotive, verification use cases
